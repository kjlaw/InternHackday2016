##What it does
Kinetic Connection is an Android app that brings the LinkedIn experience to augmented reality by using face recognition to match faces to LinkedIn profiles. Users can "kinetically connect" with others by simply pointing the camera in their direction. Once a matching profile is found, an overlay with their name and current job title will show up, along with an option to view their profile in the LinkedIn app.  

Utilized a face recognition API from Kairos and implemented deep-linking into the native LinkedIn app to provide a seamless experience for the user.
